## System Integration

### Engine Integration
All six templates are now fully integrated into the `ParametricGenerationEngine`:
- Added template instances in constructor for all 6 templates
- New getter methods: `getClimateTemplate()`, `getSecurityTemplate()`, `getAVTemplate()`, `getLandscapeTemplate()`, `getStructureTemplate()`, `getInteractiveTemplate()`
- New generation methods: `generateLandscapeDesign()`, `generateArchitecturalStructure()`, `generateInteractiveExperience()`
- Updated type definitions to include all new system types

### Type System Updates
**Updated `FurnitureType`** in `/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
| 'climate-control' | 'security-system' | 'av-system'
| 'landscape-design' | 'architectural-structure' | 'interactive-experience'
```

**Added New Parameter Interfaces**:
- `LandscapeParameters` - Comprehensive garden and landscape design configuration
- `StructureParameters` - Architectural structure and building configuration  
- `InteractiveParameters` - Interactive experience and digital technology configuration

### Template Organization
- **Category**: System Templates (vs Furniture Templates)
- **Complexity**: Expert level (vs Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Cultural Support**: Extended to include 'traditional' and 'international' options

## Usage Examples

### Climate System Generation
```typescript
const climateTemplate = engine.getClimateTemplate();
const climate = climateTemplate.generateClimateSystem({
  eventType: 'mixed',
  season: 'summer', 
  culture: 'japanese',
  guestCount: 150,
  sustainabilityFocus: true,
  spaceDimensions: { width: 12, depth: 10, height: 3.5, volume: 420 }
  // ... other parameters
});
```

## Development Impact

### Codebase Growth
- **Lines of Code**: ~12,000 lines added across 6 templates
- **Cultural Data**: 6 comprehensive cultural philosophy systems
- **Test Coverage**: 6 new testing functions with realistic scenarios

### System Capabilities
The addition of these 6 new templates transforms DesignVisualz from a furniture-focused system into a comprehensive event infrastructure platform capable of:

1. **Complete Event Planning**: From comfort to security to presentation
2. **Cultural Authenticity**: Deep integration of cultural values across all systems
3. **Professional Quality**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure generation
4. **Scalable Deployment**: From intimate ceremonies to large public events

This represents a significant advancement in AI-powered, culturally-intelligent event design technology.
