# Parameter Extraction Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The AI parameter extraction endpoint was having trouble understanding simple birthday party requests, returning generic "tell me more" responses instead of extracting the obvious parameters.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Variable Reference Bug**: In the `/extract-parameters` endpoint (ai_threejs.py line 641), the code was trying to access `result` before it was defined, causing the cultural enhancement to fail.

2. **Overly Restrictive AI Prompt**: The system prompt for the AI was too rigid, not allowing for flexible interpretation of common phrases like "birthday party" or "3 year old".

3. **Unhelpful Error Messages**: When extraction failed, the fallback messages were too generic and didn't guide users properly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Variable Reference Order
Moved the parsing of the AI response before attempting to use it for cultural enhancement:
```python
# Parse AI response FIRST
try:
    result = json.loads(extraction_result)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # Fallback parsing
    result = {...}

# THEN use result for cultural enhancement
if 'culture' in result.get('extracted', {}):
    # ... cultural processing
```

### 2. Enhanced Extraction Prompt
Added specific extraction rules and examples to help the AI understand common patterns:
```python
EXTRACTION RULES:
1. "birthday party", "bday", "birthday celebration" -> event_type: "birthday-child" or "birthday-adult" based on context
2. If age is mentioned (e.g., "3 year old", "3rd birthday") -> event_type: "birthday-child"
3. Extract numbers as guest_count if reasonable (1-1000)
4. If no culture mentioned, leave culture as null (don't assume)
5. Map budget mentions to closest range (e.g., "$3000" -> "2k-5k")
6. Default space_type to "indoor" if not mentioned
```

### 3. Improved AI System Prompt
Made the AI assistant more conversational and helpful:
```python
"You are a friendly and helpful parameter extraction assistant...
Be conversational and positive in your responses. Always acknowledge what you understood from their message."
```

### 4. Better Fallback Responses
Changed generic error messages to be more guiding:
```python
"I'd love to help you plan your event! Could you tell me what type of celebration you're planning? For example, is it a birthday party, wedding, or another special occasion?"
```

### 5. Enhanced Parameter Validation
Added null value handling and type conversion to prevent validation errors:
```python
# Special handling for null values
if value is None or value == "null":
    return False

# Convert value to string to handle any type issues
value_str = str(value)
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
cd backend
python test_parameter_extraction.py
```

The script tests various birthday party phrases:
- "I'm planning a birthday party for my 3 year old"
- "I want to plan a 3rd birthday party"
- "Help me plan a birthday celebration for my toddler"
- "birthday party for 20 kids"
- etc.

## Expected Behavior

When a user says "I'm planning a birthday party for my 3 year old", the system should:

1. **Extract**: `event_type: "birthday-child"`
2. **Acknowledge**: "I'd love to help you plan a birthday party for your 3-year-old! Let me gather a few more details."
3. **Ask for missing info**: Guest count and budget range

## Debugging Tips

If parameter extraction is still failing:

1. **Check logs**: Look for "Extracting parameters from message:" in the logs
2. **Verify AI response**: The AI should return valid JSON with extracted parameters
3. **Test extraction prompt**: Run the extraction prompt directly with OpenAI to see what it returns
4. **Check validation**: Ensure extracted values match SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES

## Future Improvements

1. Add more event type variations to SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES
2. Implement fuzzy matching for close-but-not-exact matches
3. Add a feedback mechanism to improve extraction over time
4. Consider caching common extraction patterns
